=============================================================
What I  did was used a POM design pattern driving the scripts using Selenium Webdriver.

We see promises and 

use "strict" to having strict coding standards. 

#TestCase
1.Use to login the UnderArmour site
2. username 
3.Password

4.Use Jasmine Framework for specs for unit testing and as a testrunner.

5.Still working on a full fledge framework that UnderArmour could use to integrate or take parts from the current framework I have integrate.


   Add. Solid POM design Pattern
      - Run Karma test runner
      -- Integrate Intern IO
      -- Use VOW to run behavior driven development. 
      
It a good start.
